“I want to build a full-stack AI-powered recruiter agent called Recruiter Copilot that I will monetize as a SaaS business within 1 week. Please generate both the frontend and backend, fully integrated and ready for deployment. This is not a simple project — this is the foundation of my business.

🧠 Core AI Agent Features:
Input: Job Description, Resume Text, Company Name, Job Title, and Outreach Tone

FastAPI backend that:

Extracts skills from both job and resume using NLP

Calculates match score (overall + technical skills, experience level, domain relevance)

Generates personalized outreach message using GPT-4 API

Includes CORS for integration with frontend

🎨 Frontend (React):
React + Tailwind CSS UI with:

Form inputs for JD, resume, tone, company, job title

Loader animation while analyzing

Visualization: Match score, skill match vs. gap (badges or progress bars)

Copy outreach message button

Sample data loader for demo users

Connect to FastAPI backend via REST API

🔐 Environment Management:
.env file for storing OpenAI API key securely

Use python-dotenv to load secrets in backend

💰 Monetization & Business-Readiness (Must Include):
Add pricing plan UI (Free Trial vs. Premium Access)

Stripe integration (test mode OK) for one-time payment or subscription

Add simple authentication (email/password or magic link)

Add usage limits for free users (e.g., 3 analyses per day)

Store user history and results in lightweight database (e.g., SQLite or Supabase)

Admin dashboard for usage tracking and logs

🌐 Deployment Requirements:
Make sure app can be deployed end-to-end from Replit (both frontend & backend)

Provide clear instructions for deployment URL

Set up proxy or CORS headers to enable frontend-backend communication

📈 Optional Bonus Features (If Time Allows):
Web scraping integration: paste LinkedIn or job URL → auto-fill JD

Resume upload (PDF parsing to text)

AI feedback on how candidate can improve match score

Please scaffold this project as a production-ready business. This is my startup, not a demo.”
